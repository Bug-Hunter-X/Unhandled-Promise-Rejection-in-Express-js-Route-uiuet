# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper error handling within asynchronous route handlers.  When asynchronous operations (like database queries or API calls) fail, the error might not be properly caught and handled, resulting in silent failures or incomplete responses to the client.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation using `Promise`.  The `catch` block in the `then` chain logs the error to the console; however, **it fails to send an appropriate error response to the client.**  This can lead to unexpected behavior for users.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error handling:  If the asynchronous operation fails, it sends a proper HTTP error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) with an informative error message to the client, providing better user experience and debugging information.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install express`
4. Run the buggy version: `node bug.js`
5. Run the solution version: `node bugSolution.js`

Observe the difference in console output and behavior when errors occur.
